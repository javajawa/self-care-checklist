h1. Self Care Checklist

Based on https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539317892932698152/702338373108498502/quarantine_checklist.jpg

design plan is:
 - list of things to check off
 - you can either see the whole list or, if that's overwhelming, view 2-3
   cards of things you could do next
 - ability to permanently remove (and add new) items to the list
 - big "I did a sleep" button that resets what's been done

possible future work:
 - items have a concept of 'how often' which will replace the "I did a sleep"
 - items that are not done in a long time are more likely to show up in the
   card view, but there's always one that you do frequently so you don't just
   give up
